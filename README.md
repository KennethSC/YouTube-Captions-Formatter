## Desription

This script uses the YouTube API to get the captions transcript for a video, creates a file in the users Documents folder called 'Lecture_Today's Date', and writes the captions of the desired video to that file in a formatted way. Since classes are now online, some of my professors have been uploading their lectures to YouTube. Now with the help of this script I can take notes during class, but also have notes of everything that was said in that lecture, making it easier and quicker to access/refer to specific information from that lecture by just doing a keyword search on the file containing the captions.

## Requirements

__YouTube Transcript/Subtitle API:__

To install this API (for Mac users) use this command in your terminal: pip install youtube_transcript_api


## Instructions

Copy the URL of your desired YouTube video and paste it into the script so that it is set equal to the variable called 'URL'.

EX: URL = 'YourVideoURL'


To access the created file, just go to your 'Documents' folder and open the file.
